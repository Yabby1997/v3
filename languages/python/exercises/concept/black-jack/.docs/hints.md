# General

- [The Python Comparisons Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#comparisons) and [Python comparisons examples](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/comparison_operators_example.htm) can be a great introduction.

## 1. Calculate number of card

- You can use the [equality comparison operator](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#comparisons) to get number of card.

## 2. Calculate number of Ace

- You can use the [order comparisons operator](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#comparisons) to decide the value of ace without sum of hand exceeding 21.

## 3. Judge Blackjack

- You can use the [membership test operations](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#comparisons) in `if` or `elif` syntax to find black-jack from first two cards in your hand.
